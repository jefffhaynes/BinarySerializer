BinarySerializer
================

A .NET declarative serialization framework for controlling formatting of data at the byte level.  BinarySerializer is designed to make working with binary formats and protocols fast and simple.  The Portable Class Library (PCL) is available on [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BinarySerializer).

### What BinarySerializer is not ###

BinarySerializer is not a competitor to protobuf, MessagePack, or any other number of fixed-format serializers.  While fast, BinarySerializer is slower than most of these specialized serializers as it is designed to be first and foremost flexible in terms of the underlying data format.  If you don't like the way protobuf is serializing your data, you're stuck with it.  With BinarySerializer you can define precisely how your data is formatted using types, bindings, converters, and code.

### Field Ordering ###

There is no completely reliable way to get member ordering from the CLR so as of BinarySerializer 3.0 <code>FieldOrder</code> attributes are required on all classes with more than one field or property.  By convention, base classes are serialized first followed by any derived classes.  For example, the following <code>MyDerivedClass</code> will serialize in the order A, B, C.

```c#
public class MyBaseClass
{
    public int A { get; set; }
}

public class MyDerivedClass : MyBaseClass
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public int B { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    public int C;
}
```

```c#
var stream = new MemoryStream();
var serializer = new BinarySerializer();
var myDerivedClass = new MyDerivedClass();
serializer.Serialize(stream, myDerivedClass);
```

Note that we're using properties and fields interchangeably as they are treated equivalently by the serializer.

### Binding ###

The most powerful feature of BinarySerializer is the ability to bind attributes to other fields in the object graph.  Using the available attributes this approach can allow for interop with complex formats and protocols.  One of the simplest examples of this is field length binding.

```c#
public class Person
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public byte NameLength { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [FieldLength("NameLength")]
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

```c#
var person = new Person { Name = "Alice" };
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jefffhaynes/BinarySerializer/blob/master/BinarySerializer.Docs/LengthBinding.png" />
</p>

Note that it is not necessary that NameLength contains the length of the Name field as that value will be computed during serialization and updated in the serialized graph.  During deserialization the NameLength value will be used to correctly deserialize the Name field.

### Default Behavior ###

Although most behavior can be overridden, in many cases the serializer will attempt to guess the intended behavior based on class design.  For example, in the following class a null-terminated string will be used during serialization as deserialization would otherwise be impossible as defined.

```c#
public class Person2
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

Attributes
----------

There are a number of attributes that can be used to control how your fields are serialized.

### IgnoreAttribute ###

Any field or property with an Ignore attribute will not be included in serialization or deserialization.  These fields can still be used in bindings, however properties will be treated as flat fields.  If you need to do some calculation on a binding source your best option is to define a ValueConverter (see below).

### SerializeAsAttribute ###

In general you shouldn't need this as most things tend to work out without it.  However, you can always override the default behavior by specifying SerializeAs.  This attribute can also be used to specify encodings and endianness if needed.

```c#
[SerializeAs(SerializedType.Int1)]
public int Value { get; set; }
        
[SerializeAs(Encoding = "windows-1256")]
public string Name { get; set;  }
    
[SerializeAs(Endianness = Endianness.Big)]
public uint SectorCountBig { get; set; }
```

### FieldOrderAttribute ###

This attribute is required on any field/property in a class with more than one field or property.  Only relative value matters.  Base values are serialized before dervied values.

```c#
public class MyBaseClass
{
    public int A { get; set; }
}

public class MyDerivedClass : MyBaseClass
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public int B { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    public int C;
}
```

### FieldLengthAttribute ###

FieldLength can be used to specify either a bound or a constant field length.  Field lengths can apply to anything that is sizeable including strings, arrays, lists, streams, and even objects.

For constant length fields, the serialized field length will always result in the specified length, either by limiting the serialization operation or padding out the result with zeros.  For bound length fields, the source will be updated with the serialized length.  Typically source fields are value types such as integers but value converters may also be used to update other types.

```c#
public class MyConstFieldClass
{
    [FieldLength(32)]
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

Alternatively, the length of the Name field could be bound to a NameLength field:

```c#
public class MyBoundFieldClass
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public byte NameLength { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [FieldLength("NameLength")]
    public string Name { get; set; }
} 
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jefffhaynes/BinarySerializer/blob/master/BinarySerializer.Docs/LengthBinding.png" />
</p>

In some cases you may want to limit a collection of items by the total serialized length.  Note that we are *not* restricting the number of items in the collection here, but the serialized length in bytes.  To restrict the number of items in a collection use the FieldCount attribute.

```c#
public class MyBoundCollectionClass
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public byte NameLength { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [FieldLength("NameLength")]
    public List<string> Names { get; set; }
}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jefffhaynes/BinarySerializer/blob/master/BinarySerializer.Docs/CollectionLengthBinding.png" />
</p>

If you want to enforce the size of an entire object, you can write:

```c#
public class Person
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}

public class Office
{
    [FieldLength(24)]
    public Person Person { get; set; }
}
```

Note that if the field length is constant, Person will *always* be 24 bytes long and will be padded out if the actual Person length is less than 24 (e.g. Bob Smith).  However, if the length is bound then the actual length of Person will take precendence and PersonLength will be updated accordingly during serialization.

```c#
public class Office
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public int PersonLength { get; set; } // set to the length of Person during serialization.

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [FieldLength("PersonLength")]
    public Person Person { get; set; }
}
```

Some formats and protocols will define a set of fields of specified size, with "optional" trailing fields.  In the following example, EntryLength will either be 32 or 36, depending on whether or not Age is specified.  

```c#
public class Person
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    [FieldLength(32)]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    public int? Age { get; set; }
}

public class PersonEntry
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public int EntryLength { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [FieldLength("EntryLength")]
    public Person Person { get; set; }
}
```

If age is null during serialization, the framework will update EntryLength to be 32, or 36 if Age is present.  If EntryLength is 32 during deserialization, the framework will return a null value for Age.  If EntryLength is 36, the framework will deserialize the Age value.

### FieldCountAttribute ###

The FieldCount attribute is used to define how many items are contained in a collection.  In practice, this is either an array or a list with a single generic argument.

```c#
public class Directory
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public byte EntryCount { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [FieldCount("EntryCount")]
    public List<Entry> Entries { get; set; }
}
```

*Note there is the special case of a byte array, for which FieldLength and FieldCount attributes are interchangeable.*

By default strings will be serialized as null terminated, which allows for this construction:

```c#
public class Directory
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public byte NameCount { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [FieldCount("NameCount")]
    public List<string> Names { get; set; }
}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jefffhaynes/BinarySerializer/blob/master/BinarySerializer.Docs/CountBinding.png" />
</p>

### ItemLengthAttribute ###

This attribute can be used to control the length of items in a collection.

```c#
public class Manifest
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public byte EntryLength { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [ItemLength("EntryLength")]
    public List<string> Entries { get; set; }
}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jefffhaynes/BinarySerializer/blob/master/BinarySerializer.Docs/ItemLengthBinding.png" />
</p>

In this case, the collection deserialization terminates correctly if this is the only thing in the object graph.  However, if this is part of a larger graph, we might need to also declare a count.

```c#
public class Manifest
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public byte EntryCount { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    public byte EntryLength { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(2)]
    [FieldCount("EntryCount")]
    [ItemLength("EntryLength")]
    public List<string> Entries { get; set; }
}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jefffhaynes/BinarySerializer/blob/master/BinarySerializer.Docs/ItemLengthAndCountBinding.png" />
</p>

### FieldOffsetAttribute ###

The FieldOffset attribute should be used sparingly but can be used if an absolute offset is required.  In most cases implicit offset (e.g. just define the structure) is preferable.  After moving to the offset the serializer will reset to the origin so subsequent fields must manage their own offsets.  This attribute is not supported when serializing to non-seekable streams.

### SubtypeAttribute ###

The Subtype attribute allows dynamic switching of subtypes based on a binding.

```c#
public class Packet
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public FrameType FrameType { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [Subtype("FrameType", FrameType.Message, typeof(MessageFrame)]
    [Subtype("FrameType", FrameType.Control, typeof(ControlFrame)]
    [Subtype("FrameType", FrameType.Trigger, typeof(TriggerFrame)]
    public Frame Frame { get; set; }
}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jefffhaynes/BinarySerializer/blob/master/BinarySerializer.Docs/SubtypeBinding.png" />
</p>

It is not necessary that FrameType be correct during serialization; it will be updated with the appropriate value based on the instantiated type.  During deserialization the FrameType field will be used to construct the correct type.

The Subtype attribute can be used with the FieldLength attribute to write forward compatible processors.  Take the example of PNG, which uses "chunks" of data that may be able to be skipped even if they aren't understood.

```c#
public class ChunkContainer
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    [SerializeAs(Endianness = Endianness.Big)]
    public int Length { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [FieldLength(4)]
    public string ChunkType { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(2)]
    [FieldLength("Length")]
    [Subtype("ChunkType", "IHDR", typeof(ImageHeaderChunk))]
    [Subtype("ChunkType", "PLTE", typeof(PaletteChunk))]
    [Subtype("ChunkType", "IDAT", typeof(ImageDataChunk))]
    // etc
    public Chunk Chunk { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(3)]
    [SerializeAs(Endianness = Endianness.Big)]
    public int Crc { get; set; }
}
```

```c#
List<ChunkContainer> Chunks { get; set; }
```

Note that the Chunk field is bound to both the Length field and the ChunkType field.  If the serializer can resolve a known chunk type, it will instantiate and deserialize it.  However, if it encounters an unknown value in the ChunkType field it is still able to skip past it using the Length binding.  Also note that the CRC is included for completeness but will not be updated by the framework during serialization nor checked during deserialization.

### SerializeWhenAttribute ###

The SerializeWhen attribute can be used to conditionally serialize or deserialize a field based on bound predicate.  If multiple SerializeWhen attributes are specified they will be or'd together.

```c#
[SerializeWhen("Version", HardwareVersion.XBeeSeries1)]
[SerializeWhen("Version", HardwareVersion.XBeeProSeries1)]
public ReceivedSignalStrengthIndicator RSSI { get; set; }
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jefffhaynes/BinarySerializer/blob/master/BinarySerializer.Docs/WhenBinding.png" />
</p>

### SerializeUntilAttribute ###

The SerializedUntil attribute can be used to terminate a collection once a specified value is encountered, essentially allowing for the creation of "null-terminated" lists or the like.  This attribute is not currently supported when deserializing from non-seekable streams.

```c#
[SerializeUntil((byte)0)]
public List<DirectoryRecord> Records { get; set; }
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jefffhaynes/BinarySerializer/blob/master/BinarySerializer.Docs/Until.png" />
</p>

Note that a significant disadvantage of this approach is that the DirectoryRecord object cannot start with a null!  In general, you should avoid this approach when defining formats.  However, in some cases you may not have a choice (this exact construct appears in the ISO 9660 specification).

### ItemSerializeUntilAttribute ###

The ItemSerializeUntil attribute can be used to terminate a collection when an item with a specified value is encountered.  This is similar to the SerializeUntil attribute, except the ItemSerializeUntil attribute will first attempt to deserialize a valid item and then check the equality, whereas SerializeUntil will first check the equality and then only deserialize the result if the collection has not terminated.

```c#
public class Toy
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsLast { get; set; }
}

public class ToyChest
{
    [ItemSerializeUntil("IsLast", true)]
    public List<Toy> Toys { get; set; }
}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jefffhaynes/BinarySerializer/blob/master/BinarySerializer.Docs/ItemUntil.png" />
</p>

### SerializeAsEnumAttribute ###

The SerializeAsEnum attribute allows you specify an alternate value for an enum to be used during the operation.

```c#
public enum Waypoints
{
    [SerializeAsEnum("Alpha")]
    A,
    [SerializeAsEnum("Bravo")]
    B,
    [SerializeAsEnum("Charlie")]
    C
}
```

-----------

### Performance ###

Serialization and deserialization operations are broken into four phases.

* Reflection
* Value assignment
* Binding
* Serialization/Deserialization

The first and most expensive stage is cached in memory for every type that the serializer encounters.  As such, it is best practice to create the serializer once and keep it around for subsequent operations.  If you are creating a new serializer each time, you'll be paying the reflection cost every time.

### Enums ###
Enums can be used to create expressive definitions.  Depending on what attributes are specified enums will be interpreted by the serializer as either the underlying value, the literal value of the enum, or a value specified with the SerializeAsEnum attribute.  In the following example, the field will be serialized as the underlying byte.

```c#
public enum Shape : byte
{
    Circle = 0x0,
    Square = 0x1
}

public class MyEnumClass
{
    public Shape Shape { get; set; }
}
```

Serializing this class would result in a single byte.  Alternatively, you may want the name of the enum to be serialized:

```c#
public class MyEnumClass
{
    [SerializeAs(SerializedType.NullTerminatedString)]
    public Shape Shape { get; set; }
}
```

You could also specify this to be a fixed-sized string, etc.

### Streams ###

In some cases you may be serializing or deserializing large amounts of data, which is logically broken into blocks or volumes.  In these cases it may be adventageous to defer handling of those sections, rather than dealing with large in-memory buffers.

```c#
[FieldOrder(22)]
[SerializeWhen("RecordType", RecordType.File)]
[FieldOffset("FirstSectorData", ConverterType = typeof(SectorByteConverter))]
[FieldLength("DataLength")]
public Stream Data { get; set; }
```

In this example, the Data stream will be copied from the source stream during serialization.  However, on deserialization, the resulting object graph will contain a Streamlet object, which references a section of the source stream and allows for deferred read access.  Note that this feature is only supported when the underlying source stream supports seeking.  When dealing with non-seekable streams (e.g. NetworkStream), it is better to deserialize the stream in frames or packets where possible rather than try to deserialize the entire stream (which in some cases may be open-ended) at once.


### Nulls ###

Null values are allowed; however, bear in mind that this can lead to unstable definitions.  While serialization may work, deserialization may fail if the framework is unable to deduce which fields are meant to be null and which are not.

### Nullable types ###

Nullable types are supported and are serialized, if present, as the underlying type.

### Advanced Binding ###

Binding is not limited to fields in the same object but can be used to reference arbitrary fields accessible throughout the graph.  Ancestors in the graph can be located by either type or level and can be used as references for binding.

```c#
public class Container
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    public byte NameLength { get; set; }

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    public Person Person { get; set; }
}

public class Person
{
    [FieldOrder(0)]
    [FieldLength("NameLength", Mode = RelativeSourceMode.FindAncestor, AncestorType = typeof(Container))]
    public string Name1 { get; set; }

    // is equivalent to

    [FieldOrder(1)]
    [FieldLength("NameLength", Mode = RelativeSourceMode.FindAncestor, AncestorLevel = 2)]
    public string Name2 { get; set; }
}
```

#### Value Converter ####

Sometimes binding directly to a source is insuffient and in those cases your best option is to define a value converter, which can be specified as part of the binding.

```c#
class SectorByteConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, object converterParameter, BinarySerializationContext context)
    {
        var sector = (uint) value;
        var iso = context.FindAncestor<Iso9660>();
        var sectorSize = iso.PrimaryVolumeDescriptor.SectorSize;
        return sector*sectorSize;
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, object converterParameter, BinarySerializationContext context)
    {
        // etc
    }
}
```

```c#
[FieldOffset("FirstSector", ConverterType = typeof(SectorByteConverter))]
[SerializeUntil((byte)0)]
public List<DirectoryRecord> Records { get; set; }
```

### Custom Serialization ###

If all else fails, you can define a custom serialization object.

```c#
/// <summary>
/// A custom serializer for variable byte representation of an integer.
/// </summary>
public class Varuint : IBinarySerializable
{
    [Ignore]
    public uint Value { get; set; }

    public void Deserialize(Stream stream, Endianness endianness, BinarySerializationContext context)
    {
        var reader = new BinaryReader(stream);

        bool more = true;
        int shift = 0;
        Value = 0;

        while (more)
        {
            int b = reader.ReadByte();

            if (b == -1)
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Reached end of stream before end of varuint.");

            var lower7Bits = (byte)b;
            more = (lower7Bits & 128) != 0;
            Value |= (uint)((lower7Bits & 0x7f) << shift);
            shift += 7;
        }
    }


    public void Serialize(Stream stream, Endianness endianness, BinarySerializationContext context)
    {
        var writer = new BinaryWriter(stream);

        var value = Value;
        do
        {
            var lower7Bits = (byte) (value & 0x7f);
            value >>= 7;
            if (value > 0)
                lower7Bits |= 128;
            writer.Write(lower7Bits);
        } while (value > 0);
    }
}
```

### Encoding ###

Text encoding can be specified by the <code>SerializeAsAttribute</code> and is inherited by all children unless overridden.

```c#
[SerializeAs(Encoding = "windows-1256")]
public string Name { get; set;  }
```

### Endianness ###

Maybe a quiant topic these days but incredibly painful if you're suddenly faced with it.  BinarySerializer handles endianness in two ways: globally or on a field-by-field basis.  If you're working in a system that deals entirely in big endian, you can simply do:

```c#
serializer.Endianness = Endianness.Big;
```
 
In other cases you may actually have a mix of big and little endian and again you can use the <code>SerializeAsAttribute</code> to specify endianness.  As with encoding, endianness is inherited through the graph heirarchy unless overridden by a child field.

```c#
[SerializeAs(Endianness = Endianness.Big)]
public uint SectorCountBig { get; set; }
```

### Immutable Types ###

In certain cases you may not want to expose public setters on deserialized objects.  BinarySerializer will look for constructors with matching property or field parameter names and favor those over the default constructor.  In cases where multiple constructors are defined, the serializer will look for a best fit.

```c#
public class LongAddress
{
    public LongAddress(int low, int high)
    {
        Low = low;
        High = high;
    }

    public int Low { get; private set; }

    public int High { get; private set; }
}
```

### Debugging ###

To gain insight into the serialization or deserialization process the serializer defines a number of events.  These events can be useful when attempting to troubleshoot if the debugger is insufficient (a common problem in declarative frameworks).

Here is an example implementation of basic tracing for the serialization and deserialization process.

```c#
var serializer = new BinarySerializer();

serializer.MemberSerializing += OnMemberSerializing;
serializer.MemberSerialized += OnMemberSerialized;
serializer.MemberDeserializing += OnMemberDeserializing;
serializer.MemberDeserialized += OnMemberDeserialized;


private static void OnMemberSerializing(object sender, MemberSerializingEventArgs e)
{
    Console.CursorLeft = e.Context.Depth * 4;
    Console.WriteLine("S-Start: {0} @ {1}", e.MemberName, e.Offset);
}

private static void OnMemberSerialized(object sender, MemberSerializedEventArgs e)
{
    Console.CursorLeft = e.Context.Depth * 4;
    var value = e.Value ?? "null";
    Console.WriteLine("S-End: {0} ({1}) @ {2}", e.MemberName, value, e.Offset);
}

private static void OnMemberDeserializing(object sender, MemberSerializingEventArgs e)
{
    Console.CursorLeft = e.Context.Depth * 4;
    Console.WriteLine("D-Start: {0} @ {1}", e.MemberName, e.Offset);
}

private static void OnMemberDeserialized(object sender, MemberSerializedEventArgs e)
{
    Console.CursorLeft = e.Context.Depth * 4;
    var value = e.Value ?? "null";
    Console.WriteLine("D-End: {0} ({1}) @ {2}", e.MemberName, value, e.Offset);
}
```

### Exceptions ###

If an exception does occur either during the initial reflection phase or subsequent serialization, every layer of the object graph will throw its own exception, keeping the prior exception as the inner exception.  Always check the inner exception for more details.

### Thread Safety ###

All public members of BinarySerializer are thread-safe and may be used concurrently from multiple threads.
